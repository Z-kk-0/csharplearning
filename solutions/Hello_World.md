Great! Let me unpack and review your submission.

I'll now check:

* Whether it builds successfully
* If the output matches the expected `"Hello, World!"`
* If the structure follows C# conventions

Let's get started. 🧪🔧


📊 **Score: 10/10**

---

### ✅ What went well

* **✅ Compiles successfully** (standard template structure)
* **✅ Uses classic `Main()` entry point correctly**
* **✅ Output is exactly `Hello, World!`**
* **✅ Uses a proper namespace (`Hello_World`)**
* **✅ Project structure is clean and idiomatic**

---

### 💡 What could be improved

* Nothing needed here — this is a textbook-perfect Level 0 solution.
* For curiosity, you could experiment with **top-level statements** next, which simplify your code to:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

But for structured apps, what you wrote is totally valid.
